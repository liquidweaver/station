* Each tile is an actor
* tiles are registered as a tuple representing x,y to pid
* Actions on the tile
	transform the tile's state
 	can create side effects in the form of messages sent to neighboring tiles
 	an atmospheric example: on pressure change a message indicating new
 		pressure could be sent to neighboring tiles, giving them an
 		opportunity to "transfer" pressure to themselves.
 	client visibility example: a client requests to view a tile. This tile
 		Sends messages to the neighboring tiles to "show" themselves to the
 		client. The tile could decide it is opaque and not send itself to the
 		client (alternatively, the tile could decide that it is opaque and not
 		retransmit the the "view" message so that walls could be seen)
		maybe the direction the message is propating in can only diverge once?
* "Cooperative" actions between tiles must be atomic.
* Some kind of propogation delay (a game tick interval?) must take place
